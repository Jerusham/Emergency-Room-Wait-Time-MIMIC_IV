# Enhancing Emergency Room Efficiency

# Introduction
The project "Enhancing Emergency Room Efficiency" aimed to predict and understand real wait times experienced by patients in hospital emergency departments (EDs). The primary objective was to develop a predictive model that accurately calculates wait times by analyzing crucial data points, particularly the time lapse between patient admission and nurse attendance. By focusing on this pivotal aspect of patient experience, the project aimed to provide comprehensive insights into the determinants of wait times and propose targeted strategies for enhancement.

# Abstract
The project aimed to predict and understand real wait times experienced by patients in hospital settings. By analyzing historical data, particularly the time lapse between patient admission and nurse attendance, the objective was to furnish comprehensive insights into the determinants of wait times and propose targeted strategies for enhancement.

# Dataset Description
The project utilized the MIMIC-IV database, containing real hospital stays for patients admitted to a tertiary academic medical center in Boston, MA, USA. The dataset included comprehensive information for each patient while they were in the hospital, including laboratory measurements, medications administered, vital signs documented, and more. The dataset was integrated from six relational datasets, providing a unified perspective for analysis.

# Data Pre-Processing
The initial step involved merging the interconnected tables using a common identifier ('subject_id'). Duplicate entries and null values were addressed to ensure dataset integrity. Feature engineering was performed to calculate wait times and encode categorical variables.

# Visualization
Visualizations were utilized to explore the distribution of waiting times, patient stay durations, number of subjects by race and sex, mode of arrival, and complaints and symptoms. These visualizations provided insights into patient demographics, arrival patterns, and reasons for ED admissions.

# Machine Learning
Machine learning models were developed to predict wait times in the ED. Feature selection, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation were performed iteratively to optimize model performance.

# Findings
The trained models achieved promising performance metrics, with low mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and high R-squared scores, indicating accurate predictions of wait times.

# Deployment
The trained machine learning model was serialized and deployed within a web application framework built on Flask. Users can interact with the application through intuitive web forms to predict wait times based on input data.

# Recommendations
Gather pre-arrival information to prepare resources and personnel in advance.
Use predictive modeling to manage resources effectively and reduce waiting times.
Stratify patients based on risk levels to prioritize care.
Continuously monitor and analyze patient data for improvement opportunities.

# Conclusion
The incorporation of machine learning models within emergency department operations holds significant promise for enhancing waiting times. However, ongoing evaluation, refinement, and adherence to ethical considerations are essential for sustained effectiveness and responsible deployment.
